// Make a function called startQuiz
function startQuiz() {
    $("#questionsArea").onclick("#startButton")
        document.write("blah");
        
    }


// Make function startQuiz get activited from the click of the #startButton button

// Within startQuiz function have it grab the "#questionsArea" and overwrite what is there currently (the #startButton)

// Make a timer that starts counting down for 120 seconds from the onclick button event.

// Make the 120 second timer display text showing the timer count down at the top of the #questionsArea div.

// Beneath the 120 second timer, display a set of 10 questions

// Each question will have 4 possible answers (a, b, c, d). Make it so only 1 answer can be selected of the 4 at a time.

// Each answer will have a "bubble" next to it to click and mark it as the selected answer

// Make a button append beneath the 10 questions that says "Done"
